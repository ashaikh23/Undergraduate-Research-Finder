Artificial intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is advancing the frontier of computing by endowing machines with the abilities to solve problems that require high-level---sometimes human---expertise, perform complex tasks autonomously, learn from experience, interact and collaborate seamlessly with people, and cope effectively with uncertainty and missing information.  Current research in AI includes automated planning, autonomous systems, computational neuroscience and bio-computation, computer vision, heuristic search, intelligent tutoring systems, knowledge discovery and data mining, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, probabilistic modeling and inference, reinforcement learning, robotics and human-robot interaction, search engines and search tools, sequential decision making and optimization. Applications include mobile robots that collaborate with people in an office environment, semi-autonomous driving, planning tools to protect endangered species, discovering trends in news and social media, K-12 tutoring systems, and reading the text of outdoor signs.","James Allan, Andrew Barto, Bruno Castro da Silva, W.

Computational biology and bioinformatics,"Computational Biology refers broadly to the application of mathematical modeling, high-throughput computing, data integration, and algorithm development to generate testable hypotheses about biological entities and processes. Using these approaches, we attempt to answer important questions in molecular biology, genetics, biologically-inspired computation, and neuroscience, such as how a protein folds, how genes are expressed and regulated, how system-level behavior arises from the genetic code, how evolutionary history can inform biological processes, how biological systems are able to process information robustly, and how they learn and adapt to the environment. Our research is fundamentally concerned with efficient approaches to traverse large search spaces, perform inferences over high dimensional data sets, formally integrate diverse biological knowledge, and model biological systems and their behavior. Bioinformatics refers to the data management and processing of biomolecular data often collected on a genome-wide scale. Computational biologists and bioinformaticists typically leverage data generated by modern high-throughput assays including microarrays, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy, sequencing and other advances in biotechnology.","Andrew Barto, Anna Green, Dan Sheldon, Hava Siegelmann, Hong Yu","Laboratory in Kine(ma)tics and Geometry (LinKaGe), Autonomous Learning Laboratory, Biologically Inspired Neural & Dynamical Systems Laboratory"
Data management,"Data Management is a diverse research area focusing on efficient, scalable, usable, and secure management of big data. Classically, data management has focused on structured data, but it now also includes a variety of complex data types and settings. These include textual data, semi-structured data, graph-structure data, and continuous data streams, as well as data (regardless of type) that is incomplete, imprecise, or which represents probabilistic assertions rather than known facts.","James Allan, Yanlei Diao, Peter Haas, Laura Haas, Alexandra Meliou, Gerome Miklau, Marco Serafini","Center for Data Science, Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, DREAM Lab (Data systems Research for Exploration, Analytics, and Modeling)"
Electronic teaching,"Electronic Teaching involves computational systems that communicate and cooperate with learners at many levels. These systems might use the World Wide Web or CD/DVD-ROM and asynchronous learning environments to provide lectures outside the classroom. They might provide customized responses and on-demand advice through intelligent interfaces, inference mechanisms and cognitive models of the learner. Much of the machine teaching research in computer science is multi-disciplinary, with strong ties to research in cognitive science, education, engineering, and to other computer science researchers in artificial intelligence, networking, machine learning, information retrieval and multimedia. Target applications include undergraduate and K-12 curricula, as well as industrial and medical training. Dozens of systems and courses have been deployed and evaluated, with tens of thousands of users across dozens of universities.","W.

Human computer interaction,"People rely heavily on data to understand, communicate, and make decisions. By tapping into the power of our visual processing system, data visualizations -- maps, infographics, flow charts, word clouds, and network diagrams -- can massively enhance our ability to analyze and understand patterns in order to make data-driven decisions. Information visualization researchers examine how people interpret and communicate data. We develop novel visualization techniques and tools to help people more efficiently explore data, extract insights from data, and tell stories with data.","Deepak Ganesan, Meghan Huber, Ravi Karkar, Ivan Lee, Narges Mahyar, Tauhidur Rahman, Ali Sarvghad Batn Moghaddam, Jie Xiong, Cindy Ya Xiong",HCI-VIS Lab

Machine learning,"Machine learning is the study of computational methods for pattern discovery and skill acquisition. This includes methods by which both humans and artificial agents can improve their behavior while interacting with their environments, for example, by learning effective behavioral strategies from experience or by improving the knowledge structures forming the basis of their decisions. Specific research topics in computer science include learning conceptual structures through developmental processes; improving control of stochastic and nonlinear dynamic systems through observation, experimentation, and reinforcement feedback; finding patterns in complex bodies of data with temporal, spatial, and relational variability drawn from sources such as images, text, online social networks, and biological, social, and technological systems; and using learning methods for improving discrete optimization algorithms. Much of the machine learning research in computer science is multi-disciplinary, with strong ties to research in statistics, operations research, cognitive and developmental psychology, neuroscience, medicine, biology, social science, and philosophy.","Andrew Barto, Ina Fiterau Brostean, Anna Green, Roderic Grupen, Hui Guan, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, David Jensen, Erik Learned-Miller, Sridhar Mahadevan, Subhransu Maji, Ben Marlin, Arya Mazumdar, Andrew McCallum, Robert Moll, J.

Robotics computer vision and graphics,"Robotics, Computer Vision, and Graphics at UMass Amherst represent the interface between computers and the world in which we live. To interact naturally with computers, we must have computers that can relate to their environment through visual and physical interactions, from recognizing the face of an approaching person to learning about dynamics by bouncing a ball. In robotics, our expertise ranges from sophisticated grasping techniques and novel motion planning methods to complex tool use and experimenting with new types of dynamically stable robots. In computer vision, our strengths include scene modeling, face identification, object recognition, and reading the text of signs in complex outdoor environments. Our graphics group focuses on high-speed realistic rendering techniques, intelligent 3D content creation techniques, processing 3D geometric data, and visualizing complex lighting effects. A major cross-cutting interest is the desire to model basic learning processes in humans and machines using data acquired from sensors mounted on robots and mobile video cameras. By adapting our computers' strategies of grasping, reaching, moving, and recognizing to real world data rather than to synthetic laboratory data, we are building systems robust enough to operate in realistic scenarios.","Joydeep Biswas, Roderic Grupen, Meghan Huber, Vangelis Kalogerakis, Donghyun Kim, Erik Learned-Miller, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn, Rui Wang","Autonomous Learning Laboratory, Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, Computer Graphics Laboratory, Computer Vision Research Laboratory, Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics, Dynamic and Autonomous Robotic Systems (DARoS) Laboratory "
